# Dynamic CV website

This class project is to showcase a step forward from the previous assignment which relied heavily on HTML and CSS. In this project (which takes advantage of a somewhat different desigs skiss), JavaScript is used to fetch the information from different JSON files. The information are dynamically used in different pages given the page purpose.

## Main Features

Through different script files (each dedicated to its related page), the information are classified and shown chronologically from latest to the oldest. The main page includes four tiles each representing a project (newest to oldest). A backward iteration of the JSON data file is used to reach the purpose. Furthermore, a slideshow is designed (with minimalistic CSS) for representing the other areas in the CV.

## Disclaimer

Since the project is just meant to fullfill the requirements for the given assigment, not all pages are developed. The pages are though accessible but not functional. It is possible to navigate back and forth but no specific information is yet provided.
